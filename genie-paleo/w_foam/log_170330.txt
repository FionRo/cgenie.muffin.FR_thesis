   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.2.
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!
------------------------------------------------------------
 
>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       GENIE grid will be loaded directly from k1 or mask text file: w_foam
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
>   3. READ AXES INFORMATION ...
       (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READ MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
>   5. RE-GRID MASK ...
       Nothing to re-grid (k1/mask file already loaded).
>   6. RE-GRID TOPOGRAPHY ...
       - Nothing to re-grid -- converting k1 file data.
>   8. USER EDITING OF MASK ...
       * Mask alteration procedure :
         (1) left button to turn grid cell to ocean
         (2) right button to turn grid cell to land
         (3) middle button to finish
       * Mask alteration complete
       * Revised land area fraction = 0.14043
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.14043
>   9. RE-GRID OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
       Nothing to re-grid (k1 file loaded).
>  11. USER EDITING OF TOPO ...
       * Topography alteration procedure :
         (1) left button to deepen grid cell
         (2) right button to shallow grid cell
         (3) middle button to finish
       * Topography alteration complete
>  12. CALCULATE RUN-OFF AND GENERATE .k1 FILE ...
       * Creating random runoff ...
       - .k1 saved
>  13. IDENTIFY ISLANDS ...
       * found 1 land masses
       * found 2 land masses
       * found 3 land masses
       * found 4 land masses
>  14. UPDATE ISLANDS & PATHS ...
       * updated find: 1 islands
       * updated find: 2 islands
       * updated find: 3 islands
       * updated find: 4 islands
       * updated find: N pole island (currently uncounted)
       * updated find: S pole island (currently uncounted)
       * total # true islands = 5
       * Borders alteration procedure :
         (1) left button to increase border #
         (2) right button to decrease border # (0 == no border)
         (3) middle button to finish
         [exit (middle button) if unsure WTF]
       * Borders alteration complete
>  15. GENERATE .paths FILE ...
       ! Initial E direction path follow step failed ...
         ... trying the S direction ...
       * Building path #2 ...
         -> NE corner :: Skip path entry @ (17,27)
         -> SE corner :: Add additional path entry @ (9,17)
       * Building path #3 ...
         -> NE corner :: Skip path entry @ (25,24)
         -> SE corner :: Add additional path entry @ (18,13)
       * Building path #4 ...
         -> NE corner :: Skip path entry @ (9,33)
         -> SE corner :: Add additional path entry @ (5,28)
         -> NE corner :: Skip path entry @ (8,28)
         -> SE corner :: Add additional path entry @ (2,20)
       * Building path #5 ...
       * Building path #6 ...
       - .paths saved
>  16. GENERATE .psiles FILE ...
       - .psiles saved
>  17. GENERATE ZONAL WIND PRODUCTS ...
   START [make_grid_winds] >>>
   <<< END [make_grid_winds]
>  21. GENERATE CONFIG PARAMETER LINES ...

   Congratulations! SOMETHING was created ... 
   ... hope it was what you wished for! :o)
